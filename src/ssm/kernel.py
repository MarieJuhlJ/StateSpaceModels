"""
Functions related to computing the kernel, convolutions etc. Like the ones in annotated:

K_gen_DPLR → Truncated generating function when A is DPLR (S4-part)
conv_from_gen → Convert generating function to filter
causal_convolution → Run convolution
discretize_DPLR → Convert SSM to discrete form for RNN.
